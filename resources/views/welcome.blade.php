        <h2 class="index-page-quote">A supercomputer is capable of performing 2 quadrillion operations per second,
        equivalent to 200,000 years of human labor. But it was the human mind that made the supercomputer
        possible. What, then, is the human brain truly capable of?</h2>

        <h2 class="index-page-quote">The mind’s capacity to shape reality goes beyond creating machines. It
        influences how we perceive, interpret, and engage with the world, often in ways we barely understand.
        Consider the following intriguing aspects of human cognition:</h2>
        <ul class="index-curious-list">
        <li><strong>Neuroplasticity:</strong> The brain can rewire itself in response to new experiences,
            continuously evolving
            throughout a person’s life.</li>
        <li><strong>Synesthesia:</strong> Some people can "hear" colors or "see" sounds, revealing the brain's
            unique ways of
            cross-wiring sensory experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive biases:</strong> Our brains filter information through biases like the
            confirmation bias, shaping
            our worldview in ways we’re often unaware of.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory manipulation:</strong> Our memories are not fixed; each time we recall an event, the
            brain subtly
            alters it based on new experiences, emotions.</li>
        </ul>
