    <article>Growing up, I was always fascinated by technology. I spent countless hours
        tinkering with robots and gadgets, trying to understand how they worked. Little did I
        know
        that this early curiosity would eventually lead me down the path
        of programming. <br><br>

        My first real introduction to programming came during my childhood. I remember spending
        hours programming simple robots and toys, experimenting with different commands and
        sequences. It was a thrilling experience to see my creations come to life, responding to
        the instructions I had given them.
        Fast forward a few years, and my interest in technology had only grown. I became
        increasingly intrigued by the fields of data science and machine learning. The idea of
        using data to solve real-world problems was incredibly exciting to me.
        Two years ago, I decided to dive headfirst into the world of programming. I started by
        learning Python and SQL, two essential languages for data science and machine learning.
        It was a challenging experience. There were countless times when I felt
        overwhelmed and frustrated, but I persevered, determined to master these skills.
        <br><br>

        Today, I'm proud to say that I'm studying IT at
        university. My journey has been filled with ups and downs, but I'm grateful for the
        opportunities it has given me. I'm excited to see where my programming skills will take
        me in the future.
