    <article>A striking feature of the rise of AI has been the level of concern and passion to
        which it has led. Other technological advances have generated enthusiasm and scepticism.
        Most have not led to the same claims of imminent utopia or incipient apocalypse.
        <br><br> Developments in AI have triggered a profound human response. People feel a need
        to engage in the debate around AI in a way perhaps unprecedented in the history of
        technology. This need to engage is partly due to AI technology’s unique power and
        potential. But it is also caused by AI’s ability to undermine our deepest assumptions
        about the world and ourselves. <br><br>

        In this essay, I will explore the concept of ontological shock. Ontological shock is the
        disorientation and confusion that arises when we encounter something that subverts our
        basic assumptions about reality. AI is a source of ontological shock because it
        challenges our long-held understanding of the world and ourselves. We will need to
        reconsider and expand our worldview to come to terms with AI. Ontology describes the
        basic way we understand the world to be, including the essential elements of which the
        world is composed.

        Most of us live in a condition of reasonable ontological security, in which things
        unfold more or less as we expect them to. The sociologist Anthony Giddens describes
        ontological security as “ a sense of order and continuity in regard to an individual’s
        experiences”. The sun rises every morning to reveal our house in the same place as
        yesterday. Our family greets us. The bus follows the same route to work. Friends do not
        suddenly turn into enemies. The dead do not walk abroad. <br><br>

        At times, however, our ontological security can be profoundly shaken. A national trauma
        can cause this — for example, the fall of a seemingly eternal political and cultural
        order, as happened to the Incas and Aztecs. Severe mental illness, likewise, can call
        into question the basic structures of the world. In psychosis, friends are revealed to
        be demons in disguise, and spies lurk behind the wallpaper...
